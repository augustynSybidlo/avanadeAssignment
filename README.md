Having a collection of Person objects please implement
Transform method that will return a collection of the
same type that will contain only objects with distinct
names from input collection and age that is the sum of
ages for a specified name. Output collection should be
sorted by Person Name.

You can use any language of your choice. 
External libraries are allowed.

Your application can be a simple console app, a web app, REST API or even mobile app.
User friendly interface would be a plus. But be aware that well written “transform”
method is the most important part of this exercise.
It’s allowed to have sample input hardcoded. 
However, possibility to pass the input data would be a plus.
Output data should be displayed on screen or stored in file. 
User input should be validated.
